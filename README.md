# Password-Generator-Python

This is a very simple password generator that I thought of making, so I could have more secure passwords, as well as intentions of using it for one of my classes at school.

Works in 3 stages
1. Ask the user for how long the password should be
2. Ask the user for how many passwords they want
3. Generate the password

The project does this using for loops and the Random module of Python
